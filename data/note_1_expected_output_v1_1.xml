<paragraph block_index="19">These consolidated financial statements for the years ended <Tag id="Date_Placeholder">December 31, 2023</Tag> and <Tag id="Date_Placeholder">2022</Tag> financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for at least the next twelve months. As at <Tag id="Date_Placeholder">December 31, 2023</Tag>, the Company has a <Tag id="Financial_Concept_Placeholder">working capital deficiency</Tag> of <Tag id="Financial_Amount_Placeholder">$19,821</Tag> (<Tag id="Date_Placeholder">December 31, 2022</Tag> -  <Tag id="Financial_Amount_Placeholder">$22,514</Tag>) and an <Tag id="Financial_Concept_Placeholder">accumulated deficit</Tag> of <Tag id="Financial_Amount_Placeholder">$137,942</Tag> (<Tag id="Date_Placeholder">December 31, 2022</Tag> -  <Tag id="Financial_Amount_Placeholder">$126,377</Tag>).

These factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flows from operations, and/or raise adequate funding through equity or debt financing to discharge its liabilities as they come due. Although the Company has been successful in the past in obtaining financing, there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that such financing will be on terms advantageous to the Company.
